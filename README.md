# Section A: Code Review
#Some of the parts of the code are not correct because of the use of incorrect indentation,Solution is also not defined but the potential is there for example you can just try to use correct syntax when writing your code. e.g when you open a bracket you must also close it and make sure you close it in the correct way.
#In terms of effeciency the code is not too bad because there are no too much bugs in the code because the number of bugs is four which means you tried to solve the problem
#The coding style of this student is plain, readable and simple because I am able to read and understand the code as the reviewer and a simple code is very important to avoid too much cluster.
#The student did not document the code but that is something that can be fixed take this as a learnig curve.

# Keep up the good work
